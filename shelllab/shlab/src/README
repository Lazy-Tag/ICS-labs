sdriver.pl
	Driver program that runs a student's shell program as a child, sends 
	commands and signals to the child as directed by a trace file,
	and captures and displays the output produced by the child.

trace*.txt
	Trace files that test different aspects of a shell implementation.
	For example, does the shell recognize the quit command, can it
	run a foreground job, does it handle ctrl-c and ctrl-z correctly.

tsh.c
	The reference solution

tshref.out
	Output of the reference solution for all of the traces.

tsh-handout.c
	Skeleton of tsh.c that is handed out to students. It is 
	generated automatically from tsh.c by the elide.pl script.	

elide.pl
	Copies an input file to stdout, eliding anything between
	a pairs of begin/end tag directives.

myspin.c
mysplit.c
mystop.c
myint.c
	Little programs that the traces use to test the shell.
	myspin <secs> sleeps for <secs> seconds, 1 second at
	a time. mysplit.c forks a mysplin-like child. mystop.c
	sleeps for several seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself.
	myint.c sleeps and sends SIGINT to itself.  

Makefile-handout
README-handout
	The Makefile and README that are handed out to the students.
