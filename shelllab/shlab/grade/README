This directory contains autograding scripts for the CS:APP Shell Lab.

********
1. Files
********

config.pm
	Config file for grade-handins.pl and grade-shlab.pl

grade-shlab.pl
	The Shell Lab's autograder. Runs the checktsh.pl script over 
	all 16 tracefiles to grade a single tsh.c handin file and
	emits a report on standard output.

grade-handins.pl
	A driver that invokes the autograder on every handin
	file in the handin directory.

checktsh.pl
	Runs a shell (./tsh) over a set of traces and compares the output to
	output of the the reference solution produced by ./tshref. Invoked
	by grade-shlab.pl.

handin/
	The handin directory

printdir.pl
	A handy script that calls enscript on each file in a directory.

2. Configuring the autograding scripts
######################################

The config.pm file contains configuration info for the autograders. It
defines a number of defaults that can be overridden on the autograder
command lines. In general, you won't need to change anything in
config.pm, unless you change the location of the driver source files
or the location of the student handins, or you change the number of
correctness, performance, or style points.

3. How to use the grade-shlab.pl autograder
*********************************************

Collect all of the student handin files in the ./handin directory. To
grade a single handin file (say ./handin/ac00-tsh.c) type:

	unix> ./grade-shlab.pl -f handin/ac00-tsh.c

By default, this looks for the driver source code in ../src. You can
override this with the -s <srcdir> option.  You can also use the -e
flag to control whether you want the student's handin source file
included in the grading sheet.

If you have a small class, you can run grade-shlab.pl manually on
each handin file. If you have a bigger class, you'll want to use the
grade-handins.pl driver, which will invoke grade-shlab.pl on each
handin file automatically.

4. How to use the grade-handins.pl driver
*****************************************

To grade all of the handin files in the ./handin directory, type:

	unix> ./grade-handins.pl

By default, this calls the grade-shlab.pl autograder for each handin
file in directory ./handin, and redirects the resulting grade reports
to files in the ./handin.grades directory. You can override these
with the -s and -d command line options.

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

You can expect that some handins will have problems, either because
the students forgot to enter their team information, or their code
won't compile, or their program dumps core. In these cases, the driver
flags the problem, and goes on to the next handin file.

You can print compact hardcopies of the grade reports using enscript:

	unix> enscript -P<your printer> -2r ./handin.grades/*.out

If you have two-sided printers and want to start each student's
submission on a new page, you can use the handy printdir.pl script.
